// Write a for loop that counts from 0 to 10 and AFTER ten console.logs('DONE!')
// I'll write one that goes from 1 to five then DONE!


for(var i = 1; i <= 6; i++){
  
  if(i <= 5){
    console.log(i)
  } else {
    console.log('DONE!')
  }
  
}

// Now write a for loop that counts BACKWARDS from 10 to 1 and AFTER ten console.logs('DONE!')
// hint: use -- instead of ++



// Write yours here:








// Now write a while loop that does the same things as the other two for loops. (one that counts up, and one that counts down)
// I'll write a while loop that starts at 5 and keeps going up to 50 by fives:

// var i = 0
// while(i < 50){
//   i+= 5
//   console.log(i)
// }
// console.log('WHILE OUT')
